# Am I Getting Late Again?

The idea of the app is to take in the user's origin and destination and provide
them with a time and distance outcome, which they can store and delete as per their requirement.

## How it works

Upon the loading the page, the user must choose their mode of transport and enter their origin and destination, after which they will be provided an estimate of the amount of time it will take to the cover the amount of distance they wish to travel.

The user is given and option to save their route and also delete the same as per their convenience.

## What I want to add further

As of now, the app has absolutely basic functionality but the ultimate plan is to
make it into a playfully interactive page where the user can only see/send information
from modals.

The app should also automatically toggle to-and-fro the current traffic conditions as the user chooses one from the other.

The app will also ONLY speak to the user in an extremely passive-aggressive tone, since it's reprimanding
them on getting late again.

## Problems I faced

This app was created in 2 days and as comfortable as it is to work with the google api, it is difficult to incorporate other features to the same without running into a number of other problems where the map will refuse to function.

## As of now, the app uses -

Google Maps API
Google Maps Geolocation
Google Maps Geo-coder
Google Maps Distance Matrix
Google Maps Places Search

Bootstrap for JS.
