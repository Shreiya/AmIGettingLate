# Am I Getting Late Again?

The idea of the app is to take in the user's origin and destination and provide
them with a time and distance outcome.

As of now, the app has absolutely basic functionality but the ultimate plan is to
make it into a playfully interactive page where the user can only see/send information
from modals.

The app will also ONLY speak to the user in an extremely passive-aggressive tone, since it's reprimanding
them on getting late again.

As of now, the app uses -
Google Maps API
Google Maps g=Geolocation
Google Maps Geo-coder
Google Maps Distance Matrix
Google Maps Places Search
